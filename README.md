# Contract Analysis Platform

Open-source legal contract analysis platform supporting multiple jurisdictions with AI-powered insights. Built for extensibilityâ€”easily add new countries, legal systems, and trained models.

## Features

- Multi-jurisdiction contract analysis (US and Indian legal frameworks supported)
- AI-powered clause classification and risk assessment
- Interactive chatbot for contract questions (Claude AI)
- Extensible architecture for adding new countries and models
- Real-time analysis of PDF, DOCX, or text contracts
- Automated risk scoring and recommendations
- Comparative analysis between jurisdictions

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- (Optional) Anthropic API key for AI chatbot features

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/contract-analysis-platform.git
cd contract-analysis-platform

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your API keys if needed
```

### Running the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open http://localhost:8501 in your browser.

## Usage

1. Upload a contract (PDF, DOCX, or text)
2. Select jurisdiction (US, Indian, or both)
3. Configure options (risk assessment, comparison)
4. Click "Analyze Contract" to view results
5. Use the dashboard, clause explorer, and AI assistant as needed

## Extending the Platform

To add a new jurisdiction:
1. Define clause types in `contract_models.py`
2. Add model configuration and loading logic
3. Update classification logic
4. Update the Streamlit UI to include the new jurisdiction

See `docs/adding-countries.md` for details.

## Model Training

- US model: `muhtasham/bert-tiny-finetuned-legal-contracts-longer`
- Indian model: `law-ai/InLegalBERT`
- Fallback: `distilbert-base-uncased`

To train your own model, prepare a labeled dataset, fine-tune a BERT model, and integrate it in `contract_models.py`.
